- kmeans
    - more randomization for initial centroids
    - Test set results ???
    - specifically, in k-means, is the E-step distance squared or not?
    - organize


- PCA
    - find best m for the final dataset
    - find some metric maybe for optimal m except for the fraction

- Least Squares
    - Must return classes in their primary form in the predict function

- Logistic Regression
    - Question about regularization. Should we include regularization?
    - Standardization
