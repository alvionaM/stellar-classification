- kNN
    - should we use the same k (best_k) when comparing with scikit learn's implementation?
    - cross validation??? (lab 3 ML)

- kmeans
    - more randomization for initial centroids
    - specifically, in k-means, is the E-step distance squared or not?

- PCA
    - find best m for the final dataset
    - find some metric maybe for optimal m except for the fraction
