## DescriptionðŸ“Œ
The objective of this project is to implement and apply various machine learning algorithms to a chosen multi-class classification task. More specifically the assignment includes the implementation and application of the following algorithms: 

1. Principal Component Analysis
2. Least Squares
3. Logistic Regression
4. K Nearest Neighbors
5. NaÃ¯ve Bayes
6. Multilayer Perceptron
7. K-Means

Each algorithm serves a specific purpose, ranging from dimensionality reduction (1) to classification (2-6) and clustering (7). When necessary, $\LaTeX$ is used to show the relevant mathematical background for each algorithm. The results obtained from these implementations provide insights into the performance of each algorithm in the context of the chosen classification task. After developing the algorithms, comparisons are made with ready-made implementations.

### Stellar Classification Dataset - SDSS17
The data consists of 100,000 observations of space taken by the SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey). Every observation is described by 17 feature columns and 1 class column which identifies it to be either a $\color{teal}Galaxy$, $\color{magenta}Star$, $\color{violet}Quasar Object$.

In astronomy, stellar classification is the classification of stars based on their spectral characteristics. The classification scheme of galaxies, quasars, and stars is one of the most fundamental in astronomy. The early cataloguing of stars and their distribution in the sky has led to the understanding that they make up our own galaxy and, following the distinction that Andromeda was a separate galaxy to our own, numerous galaxies began to be surveyed as more powerful telescopes were built. This datasat aims to classificate stars, galaxies, and quasars based on their spectral characteristics.
